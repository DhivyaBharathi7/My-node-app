Node.js Application with CI/CD Pipeline on AWS EKS
Overview
This project demonstrates deploying a Node.js application using a CI/CD pipeline integrated with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes (EKS) on AWS. The pipeline builds the application, packages it into a Docker container, and deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster managed by AWS EKS. ArgoCD is used for continuous deployment.
---
Features

       Node.js-based "Hello World" application.
       CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.
       Dockerized application.
       Deployment to Kubernetes cluster (AWS EKS).
       ArgoCD integration for continuous deployment.
---

Prerequisites

       1. AWS account with EKS service enabled.
       2. Jenkins installed and configured.
       3. Docker installed on the Jenkins server.
       4. AWS CLI and kubectl installed.
       5. ArgoCD installed and configured in the Kubernetes cluster.

Setup Instructions

  Step 1: Clone the Repository

       git clone <repository-url>
       cd <repository-name>

  Step 2: Build and Run Locally
      
        1. Install dependencies:
         npm install


2. Start the application:

       npm start


3. Access the application at http://localhost:3000.




---

Step 3: Configure Jenkins Pipeline

          1. Add the Jenkinsfile from this repository to your project directory.
          2. Update the Jenkinsfile with your specific cluster name and region:
             kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=default


3. Set up a new Jenkins pipeline pointing to your GitHub repository.

---

Step 4: Deploy to Kubernetes

1. Create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS:

            eksctl create cluster --name <cluster-name> --region <region>

2. Apply the Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files:

            kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
            kubectl apply -f service.yaml


3. Confirm the application is running:

            kubectl get pods
            kubectl get svc

Step 5: Configure ArgoCD

1. Install ArgoCD in your Kubernetes cluster:

              kubectl create namespace argocd
              kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml


2. Access ArgoCD and add your application repository.
